Zephyr button support is added to nucleo l432kc board.
Overlay(button.overlay) file is present in blinky folder.
Generated device tree is present in ButtonUsman\build\zephyr\zephyr.dts
nucleo_l432kc board pin D12(PB_4) or Port-b pin 4 is connected with push button.
Build, compiling and flashing commands are present in CompilingCommands.txt file. You must set the correct paths. My advice is to place the ButtonUsman 
folder in \zephyrproject\zephyr
