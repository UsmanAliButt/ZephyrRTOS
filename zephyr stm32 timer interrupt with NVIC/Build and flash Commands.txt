You can change the hardware before compilation. Instead of "nucleo_l432kc" insert your boards name.
Compiled files will appear in a folder named build. Explore it, you will find many important things in it. 
"app" is folder name, containing source and overlay files.

Overlay file is passed to build command as argument using overlay macro.   
-b = board
-p = pristine build
-d build = directory where compiled files will appear 

Build command:
west build -b nucleo_l432kc app -p -d build  -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/toggle.overlay"

Flash command:
west flash -d build
